##index2.html file and app2.javascrip file
trying to link html and javascript together,by writing a function on the header instead of the body.
the javascript file also makes use of built in javascript methods to access id elements from my html file.
An example is the document.getElementById() method. By assigning the method to a variable some of the methods that can be passed to the variable are 
    variableName.style.color = "colorName";
    variableName.style.padding = "size"; and so on.
